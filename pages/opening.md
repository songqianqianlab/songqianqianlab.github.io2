### PhD in Computer Science/Biostatistics/Bioinformatics

My group is currently recruiting PhD students in Bioinformatics with focus on developing data science approaches with applications to genomics and genetics. For students applying IU PhD program, based on the students’ qualification, the academic home department of the PhD position will be either at [Department of Computer Science at Indiana University Bloomington campus](https://cs.indiana.edu/) or at [Department of BioHealth Informatics at Indiana University Indianapolis campus](https://soic.iupui.edu/biohealth/graduate/bioinformatics/phd/). For IU students, please reach me directly.

#### Qualification requirement

* The ideal candidate should have a BS or MS degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Statistics or close related fields.
* The candidate should have strong programming skills.
* Maintain good GPA in statistics/machine learning/computing courses.
* Research experience is a plus but not a requirement.

If you are interested in the position, please send your CV, transcripts, publications to the [email](chen61@iu.edu) with email title "PhD application"


### MS/BS in Computer Science/Biostatistics/Bioinformatics

My group is also recruiting MS/BS students for hourly paid research projects.

### One Postdoc position

The Department of Biostatistics is seeking a computational postdoc at Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science in [Indiana University School of Medicine](https://medicine.iu.edu/biostatistics). The position will be offered as one-year appointments, renewable twice for a total of up to three years in a trainee position. We mainly focus on developing statistical, machine learning and deep learning methods to analyze multi-omics data (genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, imaging, single-cell genomics and proteomic data) with the goal of understanding the underlying genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases.
 
The candidate is expected to work on developing statistical/computational method and software for analyzing large-scale genetic and genomics data. The candidate will have opportunities to collaborate with members of [Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://medicine.iu.edu/research-centers/computational-biology-bioinformatics), as well as many departments (e.g., Cancer, Genetics, Neurology, Immunology) at Indiana University School of Medicine. 


#### Qualification requirement

* The ideal candidate should have a PhD degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Statistics or close related fields.
* The candidate should have strong programming skills especially in Python and R.
* Strong statistics/machine learning background.
* The candidate should have at least one first-authored publication in quantitative science.

If you are interested in the position, please send your CV, publications to the [email](chen61@iu.edu) with email title "Postdoc application" or apply [online](https://indiana.peopleadmin.com/postings/11244)
